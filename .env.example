# Found in the Azure Portal:
#   Storage account → Security + networking → Access keys → Connection string
# Looks like: DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=...;AccountKey=...;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net

# Option 2 – Blob service SAS URL (more limited access, useful for public/read-only scenarios)
# Generate one in the Azure Portal:
#   Storage account → Security + networking → Shared access signature
#   → select "Blob" service, set permissions and expiry → click "Generate SAS and connection string"
#   → copy the "Blob service SAS URL" (starts with https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net?sv=...)
# Leave blank if you are using AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING above.
